Introduction:

This is the client-side antihack project for use with Twilight Gaming's pvpgn server. It is still very much WORK-IN-PROGRESS.
The meat and potatoes of the antihack is a dll that gets injected into the warcraft process.

Current features:

- DirectX overlay (Can be extended to support a full twilight gui)
- Taking of in-game screenshots
- MD5 hash of code section of various critical modules
- Scanning of loaded modules
- Interception of new modules loading so they can be checked
- Server communication ie reporting of violations / proof that its running etc
- Module enumeration
- Thread enumeration

To do:

- Fix the multi-threading. It mostly works but sometimes causes deadlocks or weird behaviour.
- Add more anti-anti-hack / security code
- Make sure that false-positives DO NOT occur
- Get file-sending to work (screenshots etc)
- Get packets back from server without disconnecting from bnet
- Better quality screenies
- Check for portability etc
