Introduction:

This is the client-side antihack project for use with Twilight Gaming's pvpgn server. It is still very much WORK-IN-PROGRESS.
The meat and potatoes of the antihack is a dll that gets injected into the warcraft process.

Current features:

- DirectX overlay (Can be extended to support a full twilight gui)
- Taking of in-game screenshots
- MD5 hash of code section of various critical modules
- Scanning of loaded modules
- Interception of new modules loading so they can be checked
- Server communication ie reporting of violations / proof that its running etc
- Module enumeration
- Thread enumeration

To do:

- Fix the multi-threading. It mostly works but sometimes causes deadlocks or weird behaviour.
- Add more anti-anti-hack / security code
- Make sure that false-positives DO NOT occur
- Get file-sending to work (screenshots etc)
- Get packets back from server without disconnecting from bnet
- Better quality screenies
- Check for portability etc

How to compile:

There are 2 major libraries that you will need to compile this source.

DirectX 8 SDK
	I have done all development so far using the Croteam Serious Sam SDK. This includes all necessary headers
	and library files. You can download the library here:
	http://files.seriouszone.com/download.php?fileid=759

MS Detours 1.5
	I used (to be exact) Version 1.5 (build 46) of Microsoft Research's detours library. This is an old version,
	and I might upload it in future in case it gets lost in the wilds of the internet.

This was successfuly compiled under Microsoft Visual C++ 2008 Express Edition. Build options set are:
	Build: Release
	Character set: Not set (ie not a unicode project)
	Runtime library: Multithreaded (/MT)
	Linked against libraries d3d8.lib, d3dx8.lib, detours.lib (there are #pragma's for this, but if you want
	to test it on another compiler you will have to set this yourself)
